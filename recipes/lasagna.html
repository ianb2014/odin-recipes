    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li><p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange all 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 Parmesan cheese.</p></li>
        <li><p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
